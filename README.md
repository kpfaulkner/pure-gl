# Notes

This is a pure lift and shift from Ebitenengine (specifically the OpenGL related code from https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/tree/main/internal )
This is due to the fact that code is internal and cannot be used directly from other projects.

The main purpose of this is for the purego OpenGL wrapper code so OpenGL + Go development is easier
in Windows (although Linux and MacOS code is also included)
